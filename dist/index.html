            <p><span>A</span>.P.J. Abdul Kalam was an Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.

                Kalam's father was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, while his mother was a housewife. Kalam had to support his family financially from a young age, and he began selling newspapers at the age of 8 to help his family. Despite his financial challenges, Kalam was a diligent student and was awarded a scholarship to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.
                
                After graduation, Kalam joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a scientist. He made significant contributions to the development of India's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile technology. He was also a key figure in India's nuclear weapons program.
                
                Kalam's scientific achievements led him to be recognized with several awards, including the Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, and Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor.
                
                In 2002, Kalam was elected as the President of India, becoming the first scientist to hold this position. As President, Kalam focused on several key issues, including education, energy, and information technology. He also initiated several programs to promote education and entrepreneurship among young people.
                
                Kalam remained active in public life even after his presidency ended, continuing to promote education and innovation until his death on July 27, 2015, while giving a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.
                
                Overall, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was a dedicated scientist, a visionary leader, and a committed educator who made significant contributions to the development of India's aerospace and defense industries. He will be remembered as one of India's most beloved and respected public figures.</p>
